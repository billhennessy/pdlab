    <small>in 150 words</small>
</h1>
<p>We hear it all the time.</p>
<p>“How can I get them to buy more?”</p>
<p>“How can I get customers to worry about value instead of price?”</p>
<p>“How can I get people to think of us first?”</p>
<p>Great questions. But they’re all about you. Your problems. Your goals.</p>
<h3>What about theirs?</h3>
<p>Persuasive Design—efficiently practiced in our exclusive Persuasive Design Lab—produces program designs that help
    people get what they want, in the context of your business.</p>
<p>In the two-day lab, you’ll paint a new picture of what could be—from your customers’ point of view.</p>
<p>Then we’ll define a project to turn that picture into reality.</p>
<p>We’ve helped over a dozen companies with Persuasive Design, and those labs helped HON and SCENE win international
    rewards for incentive and loyalty programs.</p>
<h3>I look forward to planning your lab soon.</h3>
